## Introduction
In this project, we will explore the historical growth of Netflix subscriptions and use time series forecasting methods, specifically ARIMA, to predict future subscription counts. This analysis enhances operational efficiency, financial planning, and content strategy for Netflix.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains quarterly subscription counts of Netflix from 2013 to 2023. You can download the dataset from [here](link_to_dataset).

## Process
The following steps were followed to forecast Netflix subscriptions:
1. Gather historical Netflix subscriptions growth data.
2. Preprocess and clean the data.
3. Explore and analyze time series patterns.
4. Choose a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA).
5. Train the model using the training data.
6. Forecast future Netflix subscription counts.
